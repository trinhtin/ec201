## ✅ Sample Idea: **Web Scraping for Competitor Price Monitoring**

### Objective:

Scrape a competitor’s product prices and log them for analysis.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites:

```bash
npm install axios cheerio fs
```

---

### 🧠 Code: `scrapePrices.js`

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");
const cheerio = require("cheerio");
const fs = require("fs");

const targetURL = "https://example.com/category/shoes"; // replace with your competitor URL

async function scrapePrices() {
    try {
        const { data } = await axios.get(targetURL);
        const $ = cheerio.load(data);

        const products = [];

        $(".product-item").each((index, element) => {
            const name = $(element).find(".product-title").text().trim();
            const price = $(element).find(".price").text().trim();

            products.push({ name, price });
        });

        // Save to CSV or JSON
        fs.writeFileSync("competitor_prices.json", JSON.stringify(products, null, 2));
        console.log("Prices saved successfully!");

    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error scraping prices:", err);
    }
}

scrapePrices();
```

---

### 📊 Output Example (JSON):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Running Shoes ABC",
    "price": "$99.00"
  },
  {
    "name": "Sneakers XYZ",
    "price": "$129.00"
  }
]
```
